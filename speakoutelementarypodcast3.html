        <p>
          In the South of France, in a city called Montpellier.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Do you live on your own, or with friends or family?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
          I live with two other flatmates.
        </p>

        <p>
          I live with my family.  I live with my mom and my dad, and my brother.
        </p>

        <p>
          I live with friends in a flat share.

        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>How often do you see your friends and family?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          I see my friends daily.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quite often. There's quite a big student community here so I see my friends quite a lot.
        </p>

        <p>
           I try to see them every day.
         </p>

          Mostly I see them at the weekend.
        </p>

        <p>
          I see my friends every day at university.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don't see my family very often. Maybe once every other year.
        </p>

        <p>
          I see my family every day because I live with them. I see my friends twice or three times a week.
        </p>

        <p>
          My mother lives… doesn't live in the same city so I don't see her very often, about once a month.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>What do you like doing with friends or family?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
           With friends, I like going to the pool, going to the beach.  I like playing games.
         </p>

        <p>
           I like going out, just socialising, um, go to the cinema, eating together.
         </p>

        <p>
          We like to go for a meal, or to the cinema.
        </p>

        <p>
          With my family, generally… sometimes we go on holiday.  So we go on road trips up to northern California.
        </p>

        <p>
           I usually quite like cooking with my friends. And also the usual stuff like going to the cinema, going to walk in parks.
         </p>

        <p>
           I like having family meals, with my family. And I like going to the cinema or going to parties with my friends.
         </p>

        <p>
           Making music. Most of my friends are musicians, so we like and enjoy making music. Also, just having conversations about our lives.
