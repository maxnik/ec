        I like eating out a lot, but my husband is very upset about that. He keeps saying that it is too expensive for us. However, I don't think so; we eat especially at McDonald's or we order pizzas at home. I hate cooking and, after all, I am not my husband's slave. What can I do? (Susan, 24)

        I have just started judo lessons. I am good and I want to be even better. The trouble is that one of my friends has problems in his neighborhood. There are guys who bully people, ask for money or cigarettes, and if you refuse doing so, they start fighting. He asks me to accompany him and protect him. Should I do it? (Peter, 13)
