    <h1>Giving advice</h1>

    <div class="exercise">

      <h2>1. Match the problems with the advice. Fast finishers could think of one alternative piece of advice for each problem.</h2>
      <p>1. I failed my science exam.</p>
      <p>2. I broke my best friends's laptop.</p>
      <p>3. I want to exercise, but I haven't got enough time.</p>
      <p>4. I'm always late for school.</p>
      <p>5. I don't know many people here.</p>
      <p>6. I haven't got any money.</p>
      <p>a) You should join a club and meet other people with similar interests.</p>
      <p>b) You should get a part-time job.</p>
      <p>c) You should apologise to your friend and offer to pay for it.</p>
      <p>d) You should talk to your teacher and ask how to improve.</p>
      <p>e) You should walk or cycle to school every day.</p>
      <p>f) You should get up earlier.</p>

      <h2>2. Work in pairs. Put the dialogue into the correct order. Then act it out.</h2>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> You shouldn't feel embarrassed. Maybe there's a simple explanation.</p>
      <p><strong>B:</strong> OK, perhaps I'll talk to her tomorrow.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Oh dear. What's the problem?</p>
      <p><strong>B:</strong> Well, it's my cousin, Rebecca. She invited all my friends to her birthday party, but she didn't invite me. I'm really upset.</p>
      <p>1️⃣ <strong>A:</strong> Hi, how are you?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> I'm not surprised. I think you should talk to her about it.</p>
      <p><strong>B:</strong> I can't do that! I'm too embarrassed.</p>
      <p><strong>B:</strong> Not great, actually.</p>

      <h2>3. Work in pairs. Choose one of the problems. Then follow the instructions below.</h2>

      <blockquote>
        I think my brother is in trouble with bullies at his school.

        I like eating out a lot, but my husband is very upset about that. He keeps saying that it is too expensive for us. However, I don't think so; we eat especially at McDonald's or we order pizzas at home. I hate cooking and, after all, I am not my husband's slave. What can I do? (Susan, 24)

      <p>
        I have just started judo lessons. I am good and I want to be even better. The trouble is that one of my friends has problems in his neighborhood. There are guys who bully people, ask for money or cigarettes, and if you refuse doing so, they start fighting. He asks me to accompany him and protect him. Should I do it? (Peter, 13)
