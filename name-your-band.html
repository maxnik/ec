      <p>
        <strong>1.</strong> Have you ever imagined being a famous musician — a rock ’n’ roll legend, hip-hop mogul, country superstar, pop diva or K-pop idol?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2.</strong> What would you name your band, group or artistic persona? Why? What message or vibe would you want the name to communicate to fans?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>3.</strong> What’s in a name? Why are names important in show business?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>4.</strong> If you were a solo act, would you change your real name? After all, Amethyst Kelly became Iggy Azalea; Reginald Dwight became Elton John; and Peter Hernandez became Bruno Mars. Why do you think so many solo musicians change their names?
