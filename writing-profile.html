      <h2>About me! Hi!</h2>

      <p>
        I'm Zara and I'm 13 years old. I'm quite tall. I've got brown hair and blue eyes. And I've got a beautiful smile. That's what my friends say, anyway!
      </p>
      <p>
        I've got a large family. I've got two brothers and two sisters, and we're very close. My sisters are my best friends, really. We don't have many cousins, so we spend a lot of time with each other. Of course, we've got our own friends as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I share a room with my sisters, but it's a large room so that's OK. I've got a desk, where I do my homework, and it's got my computer on it. Over the desk I've got pictures of my favourite bands and film stars! I've also got lots of photos of me and my sisters!
      </p>
      <p>
        My favourite film star is Jennifer Aniston because her films are always very funny! My favourite singer is called Adele. She has a fantastic voice. And my favourite book is the first Harry Potter book. It's full of excitement and magic!
      </p>
