    <h1>Arranging a party</h1>

    <div class="exercise">      
      <p>
        You and your friends have decided to have a party and are meeting to work out the necessary arrangements. Here are some of the things that have to be worked out:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Whose apartment will the party be held at?</li>
        <li>Who will help to get it ready (move furniture, clean it, tidy up, etc.)?</li>
        <li>How many people will be invited? (Only mutual friends or boyfriends, girlfriends, colleagues, etc?)</li>
        <li>What time will the party start and finish? Which day - Friday or Saturday?</li>
        <li>How much food is needed? What sort? Who will buy/make it?</li>
        <li>What sort of music will you have?</li>
        <li>Any other items that need to be brought - knives, forks, plates, glasses, etc. Who can bring what?</li>
        <li>Who will help tidy up after the party - move back furniture, wash up, etc?</li>
        <li>Anything else you can think of.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You have a large apartment. You don't really want to use it because you are afraid that something will get broken. Also your landlady lives on the bottom floor and does not like parties to go longer than 11:30p.m. You have a set of speakers to play music and you are prepared to take them to the party, but you hate cooking and washing up. You would like to bring your boyfriend/girlfriend.
