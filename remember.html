    <p>
      Do you have a good memory?
    </p>

    <p>
      Can you recall childhood memories? Do you easily remember classroom lessons, or passages from books? Are you very good at remembering where you left your phone, your backpack or other personal belongings?
    </p>

    <p>
      What types of things can you recall easily, and what, for you, is harder to remember?
    </p>

    <p>
      What suggestions or tips do you have for others about improving memory?
