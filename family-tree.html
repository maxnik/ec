My mum has a sister, Martha, who's my _______, and a brother, Luke. He's my _______. In other words, I'm their _______. My dad's brother, Toby, is married to Faith. They have a son, my _______ Harvey. We often play together. My dad says that Harvey is his favourite ______, but it's a joke because Harvey's the only one he's got!
