    <h1>Do You Have Any Unlikely Friendships?</h1>

    <div class="exercise">

      <p>
        Who are your best friends? Are they mostly similar to you in terms of age and background, or do you have friends who are significantly different from you?
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you think it is possible for two people with very different backgrounds to be friends? Why or why not? If so, what do you think it takes to build a solid relationship across differences?
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you have any unlikely friendships? How did you meet and become friends? How have you kept up your friendship over time?
      </p>

      <p>
        What do you think you can learn from being friends with someone who is different than you?
      </p>
