        What are your biggest fears in life? How do you usually respond when you are faced with them?
      </p>

      <p>
        How do you handle fear? Do you have any counterproductive behaviors, like worrying too much, social anxiety or intolerance of certain things and people? Do these get in the way of your everyday life and goals?

        Do you think facing your phobias can improve your life? If so, how? If not, why not?
      </p>
