    <h1>Arranging a party</h1>

    <div class="exercise">      
      <p>
        You and your friends have decided to have a party and are meeting to work out the necessary arrangements. Here are some of the things that have to be worked out:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Whose apartment will the party be held at?</li>
        <li>Who will help to get it ready (move furniture, clean it, tidy up, etc.)?</li>
        <li>How many people will be invited? (Only mutual friends or boyfriends, girlfriends, colleagues, etc?)</li>
        <li>What time will the party start and finish? Which day - Friday or Saturday?</li>
        <li>How much food is needed? What sort? Who will buy/make it?</li>
        <li>What sort of music will you have?</li>
        <li>Any other items that need to be brought - knives, forks, plates, glasses, etc. Who can bring what?</li>
        <li>Who will help tidy up after the party - move back furniture, wash up, etc?</li>
        <li>Anything else you can think of.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You have a large apartment on the top floor. You don't mind using it for the party, but if you do then you would like to invite the two people you share the apartment with and their boyfriends/girlfriends. In fact, you think the more people who are invited the better the party will be. You would also prefer to buy plastic spoons, knives, cups, etc. You can throw them away afterwards, so no washing up! You don't like cooking very much and would prefer to order food from a take-away restaurant - pizzas or Chinese food.
