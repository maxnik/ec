        How do you feel when you are in a quiet place? Do you find silence to be calming? Or it is unsettling?
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you feel like your life has "endless distractions"? If so, how do you cope?
      </p>

      <p>
        How do you understand the concept of "visual noise"? Do you ever feel overwhelmed by it?
      </p>

      <p>
        How do you define “silence” as it relates to your personal needs?
      </p>
