    <h1>Arranging a party</h1>

    <div class="exercise">      
      <p>
        You and your friends have decided to have a party and are meeting to work out the necessary arrangements. Here are some of the things that have to be worked out:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Whose apartment will the party be held at?</li>
        <li>Who will help to get it ready (move furniture, clean it, tidy up, etc.)?</li>
        <li>How many people will be invited? (Only mutual friends or boyfriends, girlfriends, colleagues, etc?)</li>
        <li>What time will the party start and finish? Which day - Friday or Saturday?</li>
        <li>How much food is needed? What sort? Who will buy/make it?</li>
        <li>What sort of music will you have?</li>
        <li>Any other items that need to be brought - knives, forks, plates, glasses, etc. Who can bring what?</li>
        <li>Who will help tidy up after the party - move back furniture, wash up, etc?</li>
        <li>Anything else you can think of.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You have quite a large apartment. You don't mind using it for the party but the only problem is that you don't have any equipment for playing music. You love organizing things and tend to 'take over' a discussion and boss people about. You don't mind helping with everything but feel that the washing up, cooking, etc. should be left to the opposite sex. You would like to invite some friends and your boss.
