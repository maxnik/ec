    <h1>What Is Your Choice for Word of the Year?</h1>

    <div class="exercise">

      <p>
        What one word best represents 2017? Why?
      </p>

      <p>
        In your opinion, do words chosen by others accurately represent the year? Why or why not?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        One word has been judged as not only reflective of the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of this past year, but as having lasting potential as a word of cultural significance. (Oxford Dictionaries)
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Given the criteria used by Oxford Dictionaries, what would be your choice for word of the year? How does this word reflect the social and political issues of 2017? How does it highlight the way language changes over time?
