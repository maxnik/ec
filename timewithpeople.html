    <h1>Do You Spend Enough Time With Other People?</h1>

    <div class="exercise">

      <p>
        Do you think you have a good balance of time spent with others and time spent alone in your life? Does more of the time you spend with your friends happen in person or via social media and texts?
      </p>

      <p>
        What, if anything, would you change about your social life if you could? Would you prefer to have more or less time socializing? Why?
      </p>

      <p>
        Have you ever heard “happiness lies within”? What does that mean to you? Do you agree?
      </p>

      <p>
        Have you ever felt torn between wanting to be alone and seeking the company of others? What conclusions have you drawn about which may work better for you?
      </p>

      <p>
        Ask people who are older than you about their habits of socializing when they were younger. What did you learn?
