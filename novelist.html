      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>John Green has written a new young adult novel</strong>, his first since “The Fault in Our Stars” (2012), and in some ways <strong>it is</strong> very much a John Green production.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>It features</strong> a small cast of tenderhearted, manically articulate <strong>teenagers</strong>. (Green does Aaron Sorkin better than Aaron Sorkin does Aaron Sorkin.) They’re irrepressible nerds. (Among the festive topics they discuss: geography, astronomy, the hermeneutics of Star Wars.) As always, <strong>one of the girls is a tornado</strong> of enthusiasm and high drama, prone to announcements like, “I have a crisis,” when really it’s a fun crisis she’s having.
        </p>

        <p>
          And there’s loss. Death, parting, existential questions about what it all means — they’re never far from Green’s mind. <strong>People die and disappear a lot in his books</strong>, and his adolescent characters spend a lot of time channeling their inner philosophers, trying to make sense of love and suffering. “The Fault in Our Stars,” which was simultaneously an implacable tragedy and a screwball comedy about two teenage cancer patients, was of a piece with everything Green has ever done.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are few subjects more upsetting than young people with cancer. But <strong>Green’s latest book</strong>, “Turtles All the Way Down,” <strong>is somehow far darker</strong>, not so much because of the subject matter — though that’s dark too — but because of how he chooses to write about it. <strong>This novel is by far his most difficult to read</strong>. It’s also his most astonishing.
