    <h1>How Strong Is Your Sense of Smell?</h1>

    <div class="exercise">

      <p>
        Do you have a good sense of smell?
      </p>

      <p>
        How do you know if your sense of smell is a particularly sensitive one, or not?
      </p>

      <p>
        Is it important to have a keen [= highly developed] sense of smell? Why or why not?
      </p>

      <p>
        When is your sense of smell the most sensitive, or strongest, and why do you think so?
      </p>

      <p>
        Does your sense of smell help you in any way? Does it ever hurt you? If so, how?
      </p>

      <p>
        Do certain smells trigger memories or feelings for you? If so, when and how?
      </p>
