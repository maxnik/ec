      <blockquote>
        <p>
          A gardener in Perth, Australia, thought he was the unluckiest person in town when he found a tree on top of his car after a storm. Then he saw a small coloured piece of paper under some leaves. "I don't know why I picked it up."
        </p>
        <p>
          But he's happy he did, because today Martin and his wife are ten million dollars richer. The piece of paper was a winning Lotto ticket, and the couple found out yesterday they can keep the money. "We're thrilled, of course, but we're not going to change out life very much," said Martin's wife, Jean. "He enjoys his work as a gardener, and I love my job at the sandwich shop." "But we do have some plans", said Martin.

      <h2>Transcript</h2>
      <blockquote>
<p>I:  Jean and Martin, the luckiest couple in Australia today, welcome.
</p>
<p>J&M:  Thank you.</p>
<p>I:  So Jean, when did you find out?</p>
<p>J:  Martin phoned me at work. I didn’t believe him at first.</p>
<p>M:  She said, ‘You’re lying!’ I said I didn’t believe it myself.</p>
<p>J:  Yeah.</p>
<p>I:  And is it true that you’re not going to stop working?</p>
<p>J:  That’s right. We enjoy our jobs.</p>
<p>M:  Yes. People think gardening work is hard and boring, but it isn’t. I work outdoors and I enjoy it. So yes, I’m going to stay in my job.</p>
<p>I:  So what are you going to do with the money?</p>
<p>M:  First thing, we plan to give some money to Jean’s parents in England.</p>
<p>J:  They’re retired and they need a little help.</p>
<p>I:  Oh, that’s nice. And how about for yourselves? Any plans?</p>
<p>M:  Well, we got married last year but we didn’t have a big party. </p>
So we’re going to have a party and invite all our friends and family.</p>
<p>I:  Nice.</p>
<p>J:  And we’d like to move. At the moment we’re living in a small apartment. So we’re going to look for a house near the beach.</p>
<p>M:  Yes, maybe near the beach, or …</p>
<p>I:  And are you going to take a break? Travel round the world?</p>
<p>J:  Not a big break, just a short holiday – to Thailand.</p>
<p>M:  I’m not sure about Thailand. </p>
<p>I:  Oh, what would you like to do, Martin?</p>
<p>M:  I’d like to go to Greece.</p>
<p>I:  Fabulous! And do you want to buy anything else? Maybe a new computer or …</p>
<p>M:  Well, I want to buy a plane. Just a small one, a small plane.</p>
<p>I:  Oh. Do you fly?</p>
<p>M:  No, I …</p>
<p>J:  He doesn’t fly. The plane is a kind of dream.</p>
<p>M:  Well, I’d like to learn to fly. </p>
<p>I:  Sounds wonderful! Thanks very much for talking to us today. Oh, just one last question: you get the money tomorrow, yeah? What’s the first thing you’re going to do? </p>
<p>J:  He’s going to buy a new car, of course! The old car didn’t survive that tree.</p>
