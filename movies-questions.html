    <h1>What Have You Learned From Movies?</h1>

    <div class="exercise">

      <p>
        <strong>1.</strong> Why do you usually watch movies — for entertainment, to escape from the real world, to learn something new or for some other reason? Why?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2.</strong> What are some movies that you have you learned from and what did they teach you? Did they communicate a universal life lesson? Did you find out about a new culture, people or concept? Did they show you different life experiences? Did you discover something about yourself from the characters or story? Did you learn anything about filmmaking itself?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>3.</strong> Do you ever watch old movies? If so, which ones have you seen or are your favorites? What have you learned from the stories and the ways characters were portrayed back then about the culture or way of life from that time period? Does it tell you anything about why the world is the way it is now?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>4.</strong> Have you ever watched movies that make a political statement or send a socially conscious message, either implicitly or explicitly? If so, what are they and what ideas did you take away from them?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>5.</strong> Are there any movies that depict stories, characters or life lessons that you would like to see more of? If so, what are they and what do you think others can learn from films like these?
