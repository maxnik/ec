        <h2>Letter 1</h2>

          Women these days are stronger and healtier in later life than ever before. No doubt you are feeling great right now and, at 49, could probably give birth to a baby with ease. The point is, though, could you manage a 10-year-old at 59 or a 14-year-old at 63? Try to project yourself into the future and think really hard before you decide to have another baby. And I'm not surprised your husband isn't too keen - he is after all old enough to be a grandfather.

          I'm sorry to say this but it seems to me as if you deserve to be in such a state. Not once have you admitted any responsibility for the breakdown of your marriage. Maybe you need to learn how to survive on your own before you are fit to live with anyone else. I suggest you look at your current crisis as a chance to put things right. It may not be too late to save your marriage, but you're going to have to be willing to change a lot. For a start, ask yourself not what your wife can do for you, but what you can do for your wife. Take this opportunity to learn some practical skills such as cooking, ironing, and so on. And if you decide that it's your wife you want back and not just a housekeeper, then set out to woo her back.

        <h2>Letter 3</h2>

          This is a common problem, so don't allow the school to ignore it. Getting everyone involved - the teachers, your daughter, the other girl and her parents - to work out why it's happening is often the best way to deal with it. People often throw their weight about at school because they're having a hard time at home. And your daughter may be sending out signals to this girl that she'll lie down and take all the bullying. Try to see how and why your daughter and this girl are locked into this game and you might be able to help both of them stop it happening. But you don't keep quiet and ignore it as your husband suggests because bullying thrives in silence.

        <h2>Letter 4</h2>
        <p>
          Don't always trust people who phone up anonymously - they may just want to cause trouble for some reason. Give your boyfriend a chance by asking him to sit down with you to talk it over. After all, he did admit to a previous affair. But you really only have three options: sort it out and rebuild your trust in him; go on as you are and suffer in silence; or kick him out. If he avoids talking to you and he continues to work late, then I know which one I'd choose.
