    <div class="exercise">

      <p>
        1. Do you enjoy spending time outside? Or do you prefer being indoors? Why?
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Where do you go to experience the great outdoors? How do you spend your time there?
      </p>

      <p>
        3. Do you think people today spend enough time outdoors? Do you spend as much time in nature as you would like? If not, what are some things that prevent you from doing so?
      </p>

      <p>
        4. How does being in nature benefit you? Do you feel more relaxed, revived, stimulated, challenged, connected or inspired? Do you think you can get these feelings only from being outside? Why or why not?
