    <h1>What Acts of Bravery Have You Witnessed Last Year?</h1>

    <div class="exercise">

      <p>
        Have you witnessed any acts of bravery — big or small — in the news or in your own life last year? If so, what were they and what made them so heroic? Which stories do you find the most remarkable, inspiring or heartwarming and why?
      </p>

      <p>
        Can anyone be a hero? Is courage a trait certain people are born with? Or is it something that can be learned and practiced? Why do you think so?
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you consider yourself a courageous person? Why or why not? Have you ever acted fearlessly to help someone else? If so, what was that experience like for you?
