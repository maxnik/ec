        1. Think about who your closest friends are. In what ways are you similar? In what ways are you different?
      </p>

      <p>
        2. What kinds of beliefs, traits, interests and dislikes do you share with them — if any at all?
      </p>

      <p>
        3. What is great about having friends who are the same as you? What might be not-so-great about it?
      </p>

      <p>
        4. Do you have any friends that are very different from you? If so, in what ways do you differ? What are the advantages and disadvantages of being close to people unlike you?
