    <h1>Mexico's bike revolution</h1>

    <p>
      It's a quiet Sunday morning on the city's Avenida Reforma. On weekdays there are tens of thousands of cars here, but today there's not one car. In 2007, Mexico City closed its main road to cars on Sundays. That was the first big step towards becoming a bike-friendly city, and three years later, in 2010, it started a new bike sharing system, the 'EcoBici'.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, with over 4,000 bikes, 276 cycle stations, and 87,000 users, Mexico City has one of the most successful bike share systems in the Americas. Cyclists can take a bike from one cycle station and leave it at any other station in the city between the hours of 6.00a.m. and 00.30a.m. Users have to be over sixteen and pay 300 pesos (428 UAH) by credit or debit card for a year's use. They don't have to pay anything for the frist forty-five minutes of each journey.
    </p>

    <p>
      Forty-nine-year-old businessman Mateo Reyes likes the scheme. 'I only use my car when I'm too tired to cycle, but I go by bike when the traffic is bad. And the traffic is almost always bad.' But he thinks it will take some time before cyclists and drivers learn to be happy sharing Mexico City's roads.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not everyone likes the EcoBicis. 'There are more and more cyclists on the road, and that's not so good.' says Rafael, a taxi driver. 'We have to be extra-careful now. They ride in the middle of the traffic, they go too fast. It's dangerous for everyone.'
    </p>

    <h2>Is this kind of bike system a good idea for our city? Why/why not?</h2>
