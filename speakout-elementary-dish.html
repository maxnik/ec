        <p>
          One of my favourite dishes is American pancakes. I like them because they‚Äôre easy to make and not too sweet. Americans often eat pancakes for breakfast, but I  like eating them at any time, hot or cold.

          So, you need some flour, some sugar and a bit of salt, some baking powder, a cup of milk, an egg and a little oil. Mix together the milk, egg and oil in a big bowl. Then  add the flour, sugar and salt. Stir everything together.
        </p>

        <p>
          After that, you put a little oil in a frying pan and heat it, but not too hot. Put some of the  pancake mix into the pan. After about one minute turn the pancake over and  then wait about two minutes. Take it out and make some more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pancakes are really good with butter and honey or with lemon and sugar, but some people like them plain, with nothing on them.

      <h2>5. Read the email. Why does Pedro need a recipe? Would you like to try the dish?</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Hi Pedro,</p>
        
        <p>
          Congratulations! Your new girlfriend sounds great. Yes, I've got an idea for an easy recipe. I'm sure her parents will like it. People always love this dish and it's easy to make.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>First</strong>, cook some pasta. <strong>Then</strong> you need a lot of different vegetables, for example some onions, peppers, aubergine (eggplants) and tomatoes. Cut them all up into small pieces (but not too small). <strong>Next</strong>, heat some oil in a big frying pan or wok, and put the vegetables in. I usually start with the onions and add the tomatoes last. But it's not so important, just fry everything and stir it together. <strong>After that</strong>, add salt and pepper, and then lots of chopped garlic, and soy sauce. <strong>Finally</strong>, add some pasta to the cooked vegetables, stir it all around and cook it some more. That's it! Good luck!
        </p>

        <p>Or you can order a pizza!</p>
        <p>Best wishes,</p>
        <p>Sandra</p>
