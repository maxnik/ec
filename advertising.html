    <h1>Advertising a new product</h1>

    <div class="exercise">
      <p>
        You work for an advertising agency. You are meeting to discuss a new type of washing powder you are about to launch onto the market.
      </p>

      <h2>Agenda</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Name of new product</li>
        <li>Type of photographs to use in the advertising campaign</li>
        <li>Five major factors to stress when advertising</li>
        <li>Where to advertise</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Brief</h2>

      <h3>Name</h3>
      <p>
        Should be short and easy to say. Possibly one which sounds like something to do with washing or whiteness, e.g. GLOW
      </p>


      <h3>Photographs</h3>
      <p>
        Have to decide what image we're aiming for. Here are some ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>photos of product - large, clear with good text.</li>
        <li>housewife or husband using product. Clothes whiter, etc.</li>
        <li>glamour aspect. Beautiful girl wearing something washed in the product. Man admires her clothes. She says "Don't thank me - thank X."</li>
        <li>Any other ideas?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Major factors</h3>
      <p>
        We need to choose <em>five</em> of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>washes whiter</li>
        <li>low suds</li>
        <li>contains a new chemical: XRT</li>
        <li>does not pollute water</li>
        <li>non-toxic, safe for children</li>
        <li>leaves clothes feeling softer</li>
        <li>special dispencer - always pours out exactly the right amount</li>
        <li>container can be used again - cheaper in the long run</li>
        <li>smells of roses</li>
        <li>can be used to wash suede and leather</li>
        <li>can also be used to wash windows and cars</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Where to advertise</h3>
      <p>
        Should we concentrate on TV or movies, newspapers, magazines, subway, buses, trains? Any other suggestions? Which should we start with?
