    <h1>Arranging a party</h1>

    <div class="exercise">      
      <p>
        You and your friends have decided to have a party and are meeting to work out the necessary arrangements. Here are some of the things that have to be worked out:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Whose apartment will the party be held at?</li>
        <li>Who will help to get it ready (move furniture, clean it, tidy up, etc.)?</li>
        <li>How many people will be invited? (Only mutual friends or boyfriends, girlfriends, colleagues, etc?)</li>
        <li>What time will the party start and finish? Which day - Friday or Saturday?</li>
        <li>How much food is needed? What sort? Who will buy/make it?</li>
        <li>What sort of music will you have?</li>
        <li>Any other items that need to be brought - knives, forks, plates, glasses, etc. Who can bring what?</li>
        <li>Who will help tidy up after the party - move back furniture, wash up, etc?</li>
        <li>Anything else you can think of.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You have a small apartment. You think the party should be mainly for people discussing it. You don't want to invite too many outsiders. You also think that everyone should help equally. You are also prepared to do everything except move furniture. You also think it would be better to buy food rather than make it. During the discussion, you will make notes of what everyone offers to do, plus any other decisions that are made. If other people are invited, you think there should be an equal number of males and females, if possible
