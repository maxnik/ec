      <h2>Transcript</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  So, on holiday, how do you like travelling? By plane, train or car?</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  Well, I don’t like airports, so put ‘train’. I hate travelling by car.</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  Me too. I put ‘plane’ because, well, planes are faster than trains.</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  Not always! OK, number two. It says, ‘I like staying in a) a hotel, b) a selfcatering apartment or c) a tent.’</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  Forget the tent! Um, in an apartment. And you?</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  In a hotel.</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  Really? A hotel’s more expensive than an apartment!</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  Yeah, but it’s more comfortable. Hmm ... next question. Do you prefer relaxing on a beach, doing something sporty or going sightseeing?</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  What does it mean – something sporty?</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  Erm, playing tennis or maybe golf. </p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  No, thank you! Not on holiday. But I hate staying on the beach all day. Boring!</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  OK – there’s one we answered the same. So we agree about that.</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  Yeah, sightseeing’s definitely more interesting than the beach!</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  Right. When do you like going on holiday: in spring, summer or winter?</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  In spring – I never go on holiday in winter, but I don’t really like very hot weather. Tourist places are more crowded in summer.</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  True. But the weather’s better. Summer’s hotter than spring. I love hot weather.</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  Well, we don’t agree there. Anyway, next question. What do you like eating: local dishes, the food you usually eat or fast food?</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  Local dishes, I think. You?</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  Definitely!  </p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  Hmm, interesting. Next: in the evenings I like going for a walk, going to a restaurant or going to a nightclub.</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  Erm, going to a restaurant.</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  Oh, good. Me too. I don’t like noisy places.</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  Yes, I agree. Restaurants are quieter, more relaxing. But I like going for a walk, too, sometimes, so I’m not sure. OK, let’s say ‘going to a restaurant’.</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  And the last question: how long is your perfect holiday?</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  Three months.</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  You can’t have three months! The answer is: ‘a weekend, a week or a month’.</p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  OK, a month then.</p>
        <p><strong>W:</strong>  Me too! </p>
        <p><strong>M:</strong>  Maybe we can travel together…</p>
